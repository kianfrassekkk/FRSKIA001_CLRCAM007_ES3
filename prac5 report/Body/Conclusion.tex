\section{Conclusion}

The Trigger Surround Cache (TSC) module was successfully implemented and tested.
The system was robust and worked as expected in all of the tests conducted.
The next steps would be to apply the simulated code and test bench to a physical FPGA and confirm if it works in a real-world application.

\section{Recomendations}

A few recommendations highlight that there are some code improvements that can be made to maximise efficiency.
The TSC module could be improved buy simplifying the code and/or make it more efficient, more specifically the ring buffer size could be changed to be more efficient and a user manual could be written for the TSC module to help users.
Further code safety would also be advised to prevent against misuse and edge cases.
The tests could also be repeated with differing adc modules.
