\section{Conclusion}

The Trigger Surround Cache (TSC) module was successfully implemented and tested.
The system was robust and worked as expected in all of our test.
The next step is to test against miss use. Then the  tests should be repeated with a better ADC module.
Final Physical testing on an FPGA should be preformed to see if it works in real-world application.
The TSC module could be improved buy simplifying the code and/or make it more efficient.
More specifically the ring buffer size could be changed to be more efficient and a user manual could be written for the TSC module to help users.
