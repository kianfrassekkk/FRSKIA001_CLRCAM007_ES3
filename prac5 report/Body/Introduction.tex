\section{Introduction}
A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an interconnected circuit that can be customized
for specific applications. You can customize it using the coding language Verilog.
In this lab, we will build a simple TSC Trigger Surround Cache using an ADC and a ring buffer memory device.
ADC records an input analog signal and converts it to a digital signal.
A ring buffer is a type of storage method where you have a fixed size storage, and you have two pointers
- one pointer which is the head and one pointer which is the tail.
The head points to the value you are going to read from, while the tail points to
the value you are going to write to.
The TSC must be able to communication with other devices using transfer protocols.
