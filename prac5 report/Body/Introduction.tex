\section{Introduction}
A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an interconnected circuit which can be coding using Verilog and can be customized for specific applications.
This project details the building of a simple Trigger Surround Cache (TSC) using an ADC and a ring buffer memory device; an ADC records an input analog signal and converts it to a digital signal.
A ring buffer is a type of storage method where you have a fixed size storage, and you have two pointers: a read pointer which is also called the head and a write pointer which is also called the tail.
The TSC will also be able to communication with other devices using a clocked serial data transfer protocol.
