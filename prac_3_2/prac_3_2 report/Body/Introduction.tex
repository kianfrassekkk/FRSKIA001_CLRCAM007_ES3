\section{Introduction}
Parallel computing is a power tool which enables code to run at phenomenal rates compared to single thread.
There are many different ways to implement parallel programs on many different problems.
The implementation that this report focuses on is using OpenCL and C++ to write a parallel program to efficiently multiply square matrices.
Importantly, it is futile to design parallel programs that do not actually increase the efficiency and/or speed of the non parallelized programs, thus, this report will additionally evaluate the performance of the parallel program versus the single thread program with different matrix sizes and number of matrix multiplications.
