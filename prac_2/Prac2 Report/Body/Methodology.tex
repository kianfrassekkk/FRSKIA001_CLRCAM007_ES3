\section{Methodology of Part 2}

\subsection{Question A}
Create a bubble sort function that can sort an array of randomised values.
The function will be used to sort the columns of a 100x100 matrix.

\subsection{Question B}
Using the bubble sort function created in the previous question, test it against the inbuilt \MATLAB sort function.
The testing will be conducted on square matrices of sizes 100, 200, 500, 1000, 10000 and calculate the speed up from the user created function to \MATLAB's inbuilt function.
It is expected that the inbuilt function should be faster for all sizes, and the speed up should increase as the size goes up.

\subsection{Question C}
Using \MATLAB parallelism to create a new bubble sort function which using explicit parallelism using a 'parfor' or 'spmd' block
The testing will be conducted on square matrices of sizes 100 and 5000 and calculate the speed up from the user created function to \MATLAB's inbuilt function
It is expected that the inbuilt function should be faster for all sizes, but the explicit parallelism bubble sort should be faster than the user created bubble sort without parallelism.
