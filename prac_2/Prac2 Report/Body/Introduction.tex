\section{Introduction}
This report details an investigation into \MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolkit 

\subsection{Part 1 Question A}
No, the spmd block does not necessarily parallelize code in the GPU.
The spmd block or Run Single Programs on Multiple Data Sets is used to parallelize code across multiple workers in a parallel pool but not specifically the GPU. To use a GPU to process code you would use the matlab functions gpuArray() function garrayfun() will force the code to use the GPU.

\subsection{Part 1 Question B}
Before analysing the speed of the different parallelism methods, the parallelism function would have to be created.
For this question, they would simply count the number of 1s in a 100x100 matrix of random integers from 1 to 10 created using

\begin{Matlab}
    X = randi([1 10], 100);
\end{Matlab}

A function was created for a single thread, an spmd and a parfor method which are shown below.

\begin{Matlab}
    % Single Thread
    tic;
    count = 0;
    for i = 1:100
        for j = 1:100
            if X(i,j) == 1
                count = count + 1;
            end
        end
    end
    count
    toc
\end{Matlab}

\begin{Matlab}
    % SPMD Block
    tic;
    spmd
        myStart = (spmdIndex - 1) * 25 + 1;
        myEnd = myStart + 24;
        myCount = 0;
        for i = myStart:myEnd
            for j = 1:100
                if X(i,j) == 1
                    myCount = myCount + 1;
                end
            end
        end
        % sum all counts into a single array
        counts = spmdPlus(myCount, 1);
    end
    % display total count
    sum(counts{1})
    toc
\end{Matlab}

\begin{Matlab}
    % Parfor
    tic;
    parfor i = 1:100
        for j = 1:100
            if X(i,j) == 1
                count = count + 1;
            end
        end
    end
    count
    toc
\end{Matlab}

The final results were that single thread was the fastest, the parfor second and the SPMD block was the slowest.
However, with such a small data set, the overhead to create the parallel workers is likely what makes the parallel functions slower.
